    <h2>About Me</h2>  
    <p> I have recently graduated from a Master's degree in Particles, Strings and Cosmology at Durham University. I completed my undergraduate degreee in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh. I am looking to start a career in data science.</p>

  <h3>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project</h3>
  <p> My capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate focused on grouping natural neighbourhoods in Edinburgh based on the current population of food venues using data from the Foursquare Places API and from <a href="https://data.edinburghcouncilmaps.info/datasets/9961be54aa5649aebfb5f2cde53fa432_27/explore.">Edinburgh Council</a>. The project used k-means clustering using scikit-learn to cluster the neighbourhoods. During this project I learned to use folium, the Foursquare Places API and geodataframes to analyse geographical data and learned to sort points into non-uniform shapes. Since finishing the course I have improved the model and added a chloropleth map based on the average price of each area. 
  <p>This map is the final product of the project and summarises the groups that natural neighbourhoods were sorted into, with each coloured dot representing a different group. By clicking on the coloured dot within a neighbourhood, you can see the top 3 types of food venue in that neighbourhood (try multiple dots if this doesn't work first time!). The colour of the map segments represents the average price of food venues in  each area.</p>
